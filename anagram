Explanation

Test Case #01: We split into two strings ='aaa' and ='bbb'. We have to replace all three characters from the first string with 'b' to make the strings anagrams.

Test Case #02: You have to replace 'a' with 'b', which will generate "bb".

Test Case #03: It is not possible for two strings of unequal length to be anagrams of one another.

Test Case #04: We have to replace both the characters of first string ("mn") to make it an anagram of the other one.

Test Case #05: S1 and S2 are already anagrams of one another.

Test Case #06: Here S1 = "xaxb" and S2 = "bbxx". You must replace 'a' from S1 with 'b' so that S1 = "xbxb".
